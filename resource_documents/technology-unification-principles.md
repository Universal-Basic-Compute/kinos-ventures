8. **Feedback Loop**: Implementation insights fed back to core team

### 4.3. Practical Example: Implementing Memory Features

**Scenario**: Adding a new capability for user preference tracking across applications

1. **Core Implementation**:
   ```python
   # In core KinOS engine
   class UserPreferenceManager:
       def track_preference(self, user_id, category, preference, strength):
           # Standard implementation for storing user preferences
           pass
           
       def retrieve_preferences(self, user_id, category=None):
           # Standard implementation for retrieving preferences
           pass
   ```

2. **Vertical-Specific Extension (KinOS Health)**:
   ```python
   # In KinOS Health implementation
   class TherapyPreferenceManager(UserPreferenceManager):
       def track_preference(self, user_id, category, preference, strength):
           # Call the core implementation first
           super().track_preference(user_id, category, preference, strength)
           
           # Add health-specific preference tracking
           if category == "therapeutic_approach":
               self._update_therapy_strategy(user_id, preference)
   ```

This example demonstrates how vertical implementations extend (rather than replace) core functionality, ensuring consistency while enabling specialization.
