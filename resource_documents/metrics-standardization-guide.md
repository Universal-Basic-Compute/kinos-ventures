## 2. Universal Core Metrics

These metrics must be tracked consistently across all vertical business units, regardless of business model or market. They form the foundation of our cross-vertical performance comparison.

### 2.1 Financial Performance Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Calculation | Target |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** | Predictable revenue generated each month | Sum of all recurring subscription fees | Vertical-specific |
| **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** | Annualized version of MRR | MRR × 12 | Vertical-specific |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | Total cost to acquire a new customer | Total sales & marketing expense ÷ New customers acquired | < 1/3 of LTV |
| **Lifetime Value (LTV)** | Total expected revenue from a customer | (Avg. monthly revenue per customer × Gross margin %) ÷ Customer churn rate | > 3× CAC |
| **Revenue Growth Rate** | Pace of revenue increase | (Current period revenue - Previous period revenue) ÷ Previous period revenue | ≥ 15% YoY |
| **Gross Margin** | Profit after direct costs | (Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue | ≥ 70% |
| **Cash Burn Rate** | Net cash outflow per month | Total cash out - Total cash in | < 10% of cash reserves |

> **Example**: KinOS Health and KinOS Finance may have different MRR targets due to market differences, but both must calculate MRR using the same methodology to enable valid comparison during resource allocation decisions.

### 2.2 Customer Engagement Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Calculation | Target |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Monthly Active Users (MAU)** | Unique users engaging with product monthly | Count of unique users with at least one session in 30 days | Vertical-specific |
| **Daily Active Users (DAU)** | Unique daily users | Count of unique users with at least one session in 24 hours | ≥ 25% of MAU |
| **User Retention Rate** | Users who return after initial period | (Users active in current period who were also active in previous period) ÷ Users active in previous period | ≥ 85% at 30 days |
| **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** | Customer likelihood to recommend | % Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6) | ≥ 40 |
| **Time-to-Value** | Time until user achieves first value | Median time from signup to first value milestone | Vertical-specific |
| **Feature Adoption Rate** | Usage of key product features | Users who use feature ÷ Total users | ≥ 60% for core features |

> **Implementation Note**: Each vertical must define their specific "value milestone" for Time-to-Value measurement, but the calculation methodology remains consistent.

### 2.3 Operational Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Calculation | Target |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------|
| **System Uptime** | Service availability | (Total time - Downtime) ÷ Total time | ≥ 99.9% |
| **Response Time** | System responsiveness | Average time to complete user requests | < 500ms |
| **Error Rate** | Frequency of system errors | Number of errors ÷ Number of operations | < 0.1% |
| **Development Velocity** | Speed of shipping features | Number of story points completed per sprint | Trend ↑ |
| **Support Resolution Time** | Time to resolve customer issues | Average time from ticket creation to resolution | < 24 hours |
| **Resource Utilization** | Efficiency of resource use | Resources consumed ÷ Resources allocated | 60-80% |

### 2.4 AI-Specific Performance Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Calculation | Target |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Model Accuracy** | Correctness of AI predictions | Correct predictions ÷ Total predictions | Vertical-specific |
| **Inference Time** | Speed of AI response | Average time to generate response | < 1 second |
| **Adaptation Rate** | Speed of learning from new data | Improvement in accuracy after n new examples | ≥ 5% after 100 examples |
| **User Correction Frequency** | How often users override AI | Number of corrections ÷ Number of AI actions | < 10% |
| **Knowledge Retention** | Maintaining learned patterns | Accuracy on previously seen data types over time | < 2% degradation monthly |
| **AI Engagement Rate** | User interaction with AI features | Users engaging with AI features ÷ Total users | ≥ 75% |

> **Cross-Vertical Learning Opportunity**: The AI-specific metrics create a unique opportunity to transfer learning between verticals. For example, techniques that improve adaptation rate in KinOS Health may be applicable to KinOS Education.

## 3. Vertical-Specific Metric Guidelines

### 3.1 Framework for Vertical-Specific KPIs

While core metrics provide cross-vertical consistency, each business unit must also develop vertical-specific metrics that reflect their unique value proposition and business model.

**Requirements for Vertical-Specific Metrics:**
- Must directly tie to the vertical's specific business objectives
- Cannot replace or modify the calculation of any core metric
- Must be approved by the Central Data Team for methodological soundness
- Should be limited to 5-7 key metrics to maintain focus
- Must be documented in the company metrics repository with clear definitions

**Approval Process:**
1. Vertical team submits proposed metrics with definitions and business justification
2. Central Data Team reviews for methodology and implementation feasibility
3. Executive sponsor approves alignment with strategic objectives
4. Metrics are added to the vertical's dashboard with appropriate context

### 3.2 Sample Vertical-Specific Metrics by Domain

Below are examples of appropriate vertical-specific metrics that complement the core metrics:

**KinOS Health:**
- Clinical Efficacy Rate: Measured improvement in patient outcomes
- Therapist Efficiency: Additional patients handled with AI assistance
- Regulatory Compliance Score: Adherence to healthcare regulations

**KinOS Finance:**
- Risk-Adjusted Return: Performance relative to risk taken
- Forecasting Accuracy: Precision of financial predictions
- Compliance Violation Rate: Regulatory issues identified

**KinOS Education:**
- Learning Outcome Achievement: Student mastery of material
- Certification Pass Rate: Success in formal assessments
- Knowledge Retention: Long-term information recall

**KinOS Trading:**
- Alpha Generation: Returns above benchmark
- Drawdown Protection: Mitigation of market downturns
- Strategy Diversification Index: Independence of trading approaches

> **Example**: While KinOS Health tracks "Clinical Efficacy Rate" and KinOS Education tracks "Learning Outcome Achievement," both still measure the same core metrics like MRR, User Retention, and Model Accuracy using identical methodologies.

### 3.3 Cross-Vertical Benchmarking Guidelines

To enable valid comparisons across different verticals despite their unique business models:

**Normalization Techniques:**
- **Growth Rate Normalization**: Compare percentage growth rather than absolute numbers
