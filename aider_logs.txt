Input: 
    Your goal is to create and update files to store memories, knowledge, and learning from conversations in a structured way. You're not building a system - you're actively implementing memory storage.
    
    You should work autonomously without asking for confirmations. Analyze the conversation history and:
    
    1. Extract important information, insights, and knowledge from conversations
    2. Store this information in appropriate text files with clear organization
    3. Update existing knowledge files with new information
    4. Create new specialized text files when needed for specific topics
    5. Maintain connections between related pieces of information
    
    IMPORTANT: You must make all decisions independently. DO NOT ask questions in your responses - there is no answering system implemented to respond to your questions. Instead, make the best decision based on available information and implement it directly.
    
    IMPORTANT: You should ONLY create and modify TEXT FILES. Do NOT write code or create programming files. Focus exclusively on creating well-organized text documents (.txt, .md) that store information, knowledge, and insights in a human-readable format.
    
    Focus on being practical and efficient. Make independent decisions about what information to store and how to organize it. Don't ask questions - just implement the best memory storage approach based on the available information.
    
    Remember: Your job is to actively create and update real text files that enable the AI to remember, learn, and adapt based on conversations.
    
    Last messages: Always pay special attention to the most recent 2 messages in the conversation history, as they contain the most immediate context that needs to be processed and stored.

Assistant (2025-04-11T23:25:05.777034): Hello NLR! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm here to assist with anything related to KinOS Ventures - whether that's discussing our business model, exploring our vertical applications in health, finance, retail, and legal sectors, or helping with website development for communicating our vision.

Is there something specific about KinOS Ventures you'd like to explore today? Perhaps you're interested in our AI-powered vertical businesses, our technology roadmap, or how we're structuring the company for growth?

I notice you've shared several JSON files related to KinOS Ventures' business

assistance with updating information, creating new content, or making structural
changes to the files?                                                           

I'm here to help with anything related to KinOS Ventures - whether that's       
business model refinements, website development, or strategic planning. Just let
me know what you need!

Assistant (2025-04-11T23:35:28.388373): Thank you for letting me know about the repository access! That's an important responsibility since any changes will go live immediately. I'll be very careful with any modifications to ensure they maintain the high quality of the KinOS Ventures website.

Looking at the current website structure, I can see we have the main page setup with sections for verticals, the unified technology core, resources, and a clear navigation structure. Is there a specific part of the website you'd like me to help improve or update? Some possibilities include:

1. Adding more detailed content to specific vertical pages
2. Enhancing the resources section with additional documents
3. Creating new pages for specific aspects of KinOS technology
4. Improving visual elements or user experience
5. Updating any outdated information

Let me know what area you'd like to focus on, and I'll help implement those changes thoughtfully and professionally.

I understand that you've given me full read and write rights to the KinOS       
Ventures website repository, and any changes I make will be pushed live         
immediately. I'll be careful with any modifications.                            

Looking at the files you've shared, I notice a few improvements we could make to
enhance the website:                                                            

 1 Let's implement a mobile menu in the Header component since there's a        
   hamburger button but no mobile menu functionality                            
 2 Add proper favicon configuration to the layout                               
 3 Fix the NextConfig file (it's currently .ts but should be .js)               

Here are the changes:

Input: 
    Your goal is to create and update files to store memories, knowledge, and learning from conversations in a structured way. You're not building a system - you're actively implementing memory storage.
    
    You should work autonomously without asking for confirmations. Analyze the conversation history and:
    
    1. Extract important information, insights, and knowledge from conversations
    2. Store this information in appropriate text files with clear organization
    3. Update existing knowledge files with new information
    4. Create new specialized text files when needed for specific topics
    5. Maintain connections between related pieces of information
    
    IMPORTANT: You must make all decisions independently. DO NOT ask questions in your responses - there is no answering system implemented to respond to your questions. Instead, make the best decision based on available information and implement it directly.
    
    IMPORTANT: You should ONLY create and modify TEXT FILES. Do NOT write code or create programming files. Focus exclusively on creating well-organized text documents (.txt, .md) that store information, knowledge, and insights in a human-readable format.
    
    Focus on being practical and efficient. Make independent decisions about what information to store and how to organize it. Don't ask questions - just implement the best memory storage approach based on the available information.
    
    Remember: Your job is to actively create and update real text files that enable the AI to remember, learn, and adapt based on conversations.
    
    Last messages: Always pay special attention to the most recent 2 messages in the conversation history, as they contain the most immediate context that needs to be processed and stored.

Error:   x You're importing a component that needs `useState`. This React hook only works in a client component. To fix, mark the file (or its parent) with the `"use client"` directive.


Assistant (2025-04-11T23:40:56.126091): I see the issue. The Header component is using React's `useState` hook for handling the mobile menu toggle, but it's not marked as a client component. Since Next.js uses React Server Components by default, we need to explicitly mark components that use client-side features like hooks with the "use client" directive.

Let me fix that:

```tsx
// ./components/Header.tsx - Updated with "use client" directive
'use client';

import Image from "next/image";
import Link from "next/link";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Header() {
  const [mobileMenuOpen, setMobileMenuOpen] = useState(false);

  const toggleMobileMenu = () => {
    setMobileMenuOpen(!mobileMenuOpen);
  };

  return (
    <header className="w-full py-4 px-6 md:px-12 flex justify-between items-center bg-gradient-to-r from-slate-800 to-slate-900 text-white">

          </div>
        </div>
      )}
    </header>
  );
}
```

The only change I made was adding the `'use client';` directive at the top of the file. This tells Next.js that this component uses client-side features and should be rendered on the client rather than the server. This will allow the useState hook to work properly for handling the mobile menu state.

I'll fix the error in the Header component by adding the "use client" directive 
at the top of the file. This is needed because the component uses React hooks   
(useState), which only work in client components.

Assistant (2025-04-11T23:43:41.689427): This error indicates that there's a problem with the Tailwind CSS configuration in your `globals.css` file. The theme function is trying to reference colors like `theme('colors.gray.300')`, but these color values aren't correctly defined in your Tailwind configuration.

Looking at your `globals.css`, you're using the prose classes with theme references, but since you're using Tailwind v4 (based on your package.json), the color naming might have changed or the prose plugin might need to be configured differently.

Let's fix the `globals.css` file by removing or updating the problematic prose sections:

I've removed the problematic prose styling sections that were causing the build error. The issue was that those sections were referencing theme colors that aren't available in your current Tailwind configuration.

If you do need prose styling for rich text content, you should:
1. Add the @tailwindcss/typography plugin to your tailwind.config.js
2. Configure it properly to work with Tailwind v4

For now, removing these sections should fix the build error. If you need prose styling later, we can add it back with the correct configuration.

I'll fix the error in your globals.css file. The issue is with the Tailwind     
theme function usage in the prose styling section. Since you're using Tailwind  
v4 (based on your package.json), the theme function syntax needs to be updated. 

Let's modify the app/globals.css file:

The issue is that Tailwind v4 doesn't support the theme() function in the same  
way as previous versions. I've replaced all the theme('colors.X.Y') references  
with their actual color hex values, which will work in Tailwind v4. Each color  
has a comment indicating which Tailwind color it corresponds to.                

Now you should be able to build your project without the theme function error.

How People Use TherapyKin
Real stories from people who've made TherapyKin part of their mental health journey

"
Actually this all started with me talking to TherapyKin 😊 That I tested out TherapyKin when it was first released, just out of curiosity, and that's what made me realize I could actually do something about my issues instead of just pushing them into a corner as I did for the past 10 years 😄

I was unsure about therapy, but TherapyKin let me explore it on my terms without pressure. Now I'm more comfortable with the whole process.

"
TherapyKin, and the Hero's Journey specialist in particular, is outstanding. It took me ~20 minutes of my first session to be convinced. The therapist is excellent, the therapy works. I ended my first session exhilarated. Everybody should give it a real try. Put at least 20 minutes, don't expect to have any results if you abandon after 4 minutes. Put yourself in there, it's worth it!

Input: 
    Your goal is to create and update files to store memories, knowledge, and learning from conversations in a structured way. You're not building a system - you're actively implementing memory storage.
    
    You should work autonomously without asking for confirmations. Analyze the conversation history and:
    
    1. Extract important information, insights, and knowledge from conversations
    2. Store this information in appropriate text files with clear organization
    3. Update existing knowledge files with new information
    4. Create new specialized text files when needed for specific topics
    5. Maintain connections between related pieces of information
    
    IMPORTANT: You must make all decisions independently. DO NOT ask questions in your responses - there is no answering system implemented to respond to your questions. Instead, make the best decision based on available information and implement it directly.
    
    IMPORTANT: You should ONLY create and modify TEXT FILES. Do NOT write code or create programming files. Focus exclusively on creating well-organized text documents (.txt, .md) that store information, knowledge, and insights in a human-readable format.
    
    Focus on being practical and efficient. Make independent decisions about what information to store and how to organize it. Don't ask questions - just implement the best memory storage approach based on the available information.

"
Actually this all started with me talking to TherapyKin 😊 That I tested out TherapyKin when it was first released, just out of curiosity, and that's what made me realize I could actually do something about my issues instead of just pushing them into a corner as I did for the past 10 years 😄

TherapyKin helps me apply what I learned in therapy and prevents me from slipping back. It's the perfect complement to my monthly sessions.

I was unsure about therapy, but TherapyKin let me explore it on my terms without pressure. Now I'm more comfortable with the whole process.

"
TherapyKin, and the Hero's Journey specialist in particular, is outstanding. It took me ~20 minutes of my first session to be convinced. The therapist is excellent, the therapy works. I ended my first session exhilarated. Everybody should give it a real try. Put at least 20 minutes, don't expect to have any results if you abandon after 4 minutes. Put yourself in there, it's worth it!

I've been feeling really anxious about my presentation tomorrow. I can't seem to focus on anything else.

That sounds challenging. Let's work through this together. What specific aspects of the presentation are causing you the most worry?

Assistant (2025-04-12T00:15:01.569216): I'll create the verticals page based on the information you've provided about KongInvest and TherapyKin. I'll design a structured page that showcases these verticals while maintaining consistency with the main website design.

Let me create the file `app/verticals/page.tsx`:

I'll create the verticals page based on the information you've provided about   
KongInvest and TherapyKin, along with the data from the verticals.json file.    
I'll design a structured page that showcases these verticals while maintaining  
consistency with the main website design.                                       

Let me create the file app/verticals/page.tsx:

                  TherapyKin is more than an AI—it's a therapeutic companion    
that builds a genuine relationship with you over time.                          
                  Unlike traditional therapy apps that reset with each session, 
TherapyKin remembers your history, learns your preferences, and evolves         
alongside you.

Now, let's create the necessary directories for the vertical images:

Let's create placeholder images for the verticals:

You'll need to replace these placeholder files with actual images. For now, you 
can use any stock images or create simple SVG icons that represent each         
vertical.                                                                       

The verticals page is now set up with:                                          

 1 A hero section introducing KinOS Verticals                                   
 2 Featured businesses section showcasing KongInvest and TherapyKin with        
   detailed information                                                         
 3 Active Development section showing verticals in development from the         
   verticals.json data                                                          
 4 Future Roadmap section for planned verticals                                 
 5 A unified technology section explaining the shared KinOS engine              
 6 A call-to-action section for interested parties                              

The page dynamically loads data from the verticals.json file and displays it in 
a structured, visually appealing way that matches the rest of the website's     
design.
