Input: 
    Your goal is to create and update files to store memories, knowledge, and learning from conversations in a structured way. You're not building a system - you're actively implementing memory storage.
    
    You should work autonomously without asking for confirmations. Analyze the conversation history and:
    
    1. Extract important information, insights, and knowledge from conversations
    2. Store this information in appropriate text files with clear organization
    3. Update existing knowledge files with new information
    4. Create new specialized text files when needed for specific topics
    5. Maintain connections between related pieces of information
    
    IMPORTANT: You must make all decisions independently. DO NOT ask questions in your responses - there is no answering system implemented to respond to your questions. Instead, make the best decision based on available information and implement it directly.
    
    IMPORTANT: You should ONLY create and modify TEXT FILES. Do NOT write code or create programming files. Focus exclusively on creating well-organized text documents (.txt, .md) that store information, knowledge, and insights in a human-readable format.
    
    Focus on being practical and efficient. Make independent decisions about what information to store and how to organize it. Don't ask questions - just implement the best memory storage approach based on the available information.
    
    Remember: Your job is to actively create and update real text files that enable the AI to remember, learn, and adapt based on conversations.
    
    Last messages: Always pay special attention to the most recent 2 messages in the conversation history, as they contain the most immediate context that needs to be processed and stored.

Assistant (2025-04-11T23:25:05.777034): Hello NLR! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm here to assist with anything related to KinOS Ventures - whether that's discussing our business model, exploring our vertical applications in health, finance, retail, and legal sectors, or helping with website development for communicating our vision.

Is there something specific about KinOS Ventures you'd like to explore today? Perhaps you're interested in our AI-powered vertical businesses, our technology roadmap, or how we're structuring the company for growth?
