    "content": "I see the issue. The Header component is using React's `useState` hook for handling the mobile menu toggle, but it's not marked as a client component. Since Next.js uses React Server Components by default, we need to explicitly mark components that use client-side features like hooks with the \"use client\" directive.\n\nLet me fix that:\n\n```tsx\n// ./components/Header.tsx - Updated with \"use client\" directive\n'use client';\n\nimport Image from \"next/image\";\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function Header() {\n  const [mobileMenuOpen, setMobileMenuOpen] = useState(false);\n\n  const toggleMobileMenu = () => {\n    setMobileMenuOpen(!mobileMenuOpen);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <header className=\"w-full py-4 px-6 md:px-12 flex justify-between items-center bg-gradient-to-r from-slate-800 to-slate-900 text-white\">\n      <div className=\"flex items-center\">\n        <Link href=\"/\" className=\"flex items-center\">\n          <Image\n            src=\"/kinos-logo.png\"\n            alt=\"KinOS Ventures Logo\"\n            width={40}\n            height={40}\n            className=\"mr-3\"\n          />\n          <span className=\"text-xl font-semibold\">KinOS Ventures</span>\n        </Link>\n      </div>\n      <nav className=\"hidden md:flex space-x-8\">\n        <Link href=\"/resources\" className=\"hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors\">\n          Resources\n        </Link>\n        <Link href=\"/verticals\" className=\"hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors\">\n          Verticals\n        </Link>\n        <Link href=\"/about\" className=\"hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors\">\n          About\n        </Link>\n        <Link href=\"/contact\" className=\"hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors\">\n          Contact\n        </Link>\n      </nav>\n      <div className=\"md:hidden\">\n        <button className=\"text-white\" onClick={toggleMobileMenu} aria-label=\"Toggle menu\">\n          <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" stroke=\"currentColor\" className=\"w-6 h-6\">\n            <path strokeLinecap=\"round\" strokeLinejoin=\"round\" strokeWidth={2} d=\"M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16\" />\n          </svg>\n        </button>\n      </div>\n\n      {/* Mobile Menu */}\n      {mobileMenuOpen && (\n        <div className=\"absolute top-16 left-0 right-0 bg-slate-800 z-50 md:hidden animate-fadeIn\">\n          <div className=\"flex flex-col p-4 border-t border-slate-700\">\n            <Link \n              href=\"/resources\" \n              className=\"py-3 px-4 hover:bg-slate-700 rounded-md transition-colors\"\n              onClick={() => setMobileMenuOpen(false)}\n            >\n              Resources\n            </Link>\n            <Link \n              href=\"/verticals\" \n              className=\"py-3 px-4 hover:bg-slate-700 rounded-md transition-colors\"\n              onClick={() => setMobileMenuOpen(false)}\n            >\n              Verticals\n            </Link>\n            <Link \n              href=\"/about\" \n              className=\"py-3 px-4 hover:bg-slate-700 rounded-md transition-colors\"\n              onClick={() => setMobileMenuOpen(false)}\n            >\n              About\n            </Link>\n            <Link \n              href=\"/contact\" \n              className=\"py-3 px-4 hover:bg-slate-700 rounded-md transition-colors\"\n              onClick={() => setMobileMenuOpen(false)}\n            >\n              Contact\n            </Link>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      )}\n    </header>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe only change I made was adding the `'use client';` directive at the top of the file. This tells Next.js that this component uses client-side features and should be rendered on the client rather than the server. This will allow the useState hook to work properly for handling the mobile menu state.",
