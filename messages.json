This tells Next.js that this component uses client-side features and should be rendered on the client rather than the server. This will allow the useState hook to work properly for handling the mobile menu state.",

Add the @tailwindcss/typography plugin to your tailwind.config.js\n2. Configure it properly to work with Tailwind v4\n\nFor now, removing these sections should fix the build error. If you need prose styling later, we can add it back with the correct configuration.",

Now I'm more comfortable with the whole process.\n\nJ\nJordan\n\nDesigner\n\n\"\nTherapyKin, and the Hero's Journey specialist in particular, is outstanding. It took me ~20 minutes of my first session to be convinced. The therapist is excellent, the therapy works. I ended my first session exhilarated. Everybody should give it a real try. Put at least 20 minutes, don't expect to have any results if you abandon after 4 minutes. Put yourself in there, it's worth it!\n\nN\nNicolas R.\n\nEarly Adopter\n\n\"\nAs a night shift worker, TherapyKin is there when my thoughts get heaviest at 3AM.
